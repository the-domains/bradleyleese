  MISSION STATEMENT I will die with a smile on my face if I have done everything
  in my power to better my family and to bring us closer. I want to provide my
  wife with a better life than the one she has known and I want to give my
  children the tools to invent their own futures. In the time I have left I want
  to help provide people a safe haven where they are loved and cherished.

MISSION STATEMENT  
I will die with a smile on my face if I have done everything in my power to better my family and to bring us closer. I want to provide my wife with a better life than the one she has known and I want to give my children the tools to invent their own futures. In the time I have left I want to help provide people a safe haven where they are loved and cherished.
